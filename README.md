# Go Book: My Journey to Mastering Go

Welcome to **Go Book**, the repository where I document my learning journey with the Go programming language. As a TypeScript developer diving into Go, this repo is an ongoing experiment, and you're welcome to explore the code and follow along as I go deeper into the Go ecosystem.

## 🚀 What is This?

This repository is a collection of my Go code samples, experiments, and notes. It’s like a "Go Handbook" but personalized—featuring everything from basic syntax to advanced concepts as I grow in my Go skills.

## 🧑‍💻 What's Inside?

- **Code Samples**: A variety of Go programs that I’m working on.
- **Learning Notes**: Insights, tutorials, and personal reflections on Go.
- **Projects**: Mini projects that I build to understand different Go features (like web servers, APIs, and database connections).
- **Fun Stuff**: Because learning should be fun! Expect quirky experiments along the way.

## 🔧 How to Run the Code?

Clone the repository and run it with Go:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/henry-insomniac/go-book.git
cd go-book
go run main.go
```

If you have any issues or improvements, feel free to contribute!

## 🏆 What’s Next?

The journey is just beginning! I plan to explore:

- Go web frameworks (Gin, Echo, etc.)
- More advanced database connections
- Go routines and concurrency

### Feel free to fork this repo, contribute, and learn together with me. Happy coding! ✨
